# Log Collector

Easy and simple way to find the files hidden on your computer.

Small project that supposed to be only for logs collecting can now be used to collect all files types or names from the computer.

Currently still plenty of bugs (working on improvements)

How it works:

When you will run Log Collector you can select file name or just file extension (i.e. *.log) then folder that should be search and Log Collector will return you the list of all the files founded.

Using the drop down menu you can save the list of the files or you can copy all the files to one location.
